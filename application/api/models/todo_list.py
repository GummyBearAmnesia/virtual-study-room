toDoList Model:
    This is a model that manages the toDoList items in the database, each item has various attributes.

Model Breakdown:
    list_id -> Primary key to uniquely identify each toDoList item in the database.
    title -> CharField of max 255 characters, to give each toDoList item a title. This is set by the user (and cannot be empty) and stored as an attribute to the toDoList item.
    content -> CharField but has no limit of characters and can remain empty, this is all set by the user and stored as an attribute.
    creation_date -> DateField and this automatically sets that field to the current date. This is effectively a read-only field.
    is_completed -> BooleanField that is set to false by default, this indiacted whether the user has completed the task.
    is_shared -> BooleanField that is also set to false by default, this field is to mark whether the user wants to share the toDolist item with others.

save Method:
    This makes sure that after the creation_date has been added as a field, it can't be amended.

str Method:
    This prints out the title and list_id of the toDoList item, in the database, useful for debugging.
